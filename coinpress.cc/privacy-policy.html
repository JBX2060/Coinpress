            <p class="mb-4">Welcome to CoinPress!</p>

            <p class="mb-4">CoinPress and its affiliates (collectively, “<strong>CoinPress</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,”
                “<strong>us</strong>,” or “<strong>our</strong>”) developed this Privacy Policy to explain how we
                collect, use, share, and protect your Personal Information (defined below), and your choices about
                he collection and use of your Personal Information.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">This Privacy Policy applies to Personal Information collected or processed through our websites
                (collectively, the “<strong>Site</strong>”) and applications (collectively, the “<strong>App</strong>”)
                that link to this Privacy Policy (the Site together with the App, collectively, the “<strong>Service</strong>”).</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">1. What is Personal Information?</p>

            <p class="mb-4">“<strong>Personal Information</strong>” is information that, either alone or in combination with other
                information, identifies you. When we combine Personal Information with other information (i.e., information
                that does not, on its own, identify you), we treat the combined information as Personal Information.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">2. How We Collect and Use Personal Information</p>

            <p class="font-bold text-grey-darkest mb-4">A.  Information that You Provide Us</p>

                        We process the information, including Personal Information, collected through such technologies
                        to further our legitimate interests in operating the Service, enhancing your experience through

                        some functionality may be limited or unavailable. If you disable cookies or device identifiers,
                        you may continue to receive advertisements, but these advertisements will no longer be tailored to

                    <p class="mb-4">When you use our Service, our servers may automatically record information, including your Internet
                        Protocol address (“<strong>IP Address</strong>”), browser type, referring URLs (e.g., the site you

                        such information (collectively, “Log File Information”). We may also collect similar information
                        from emails sent to you which then help us track which emails are opened and which links are
                        clicked by recipients. We use Log File Information collected from our implementation of the Service
                        to further our legitimate interests in securing the Service by identifying potential threats and
                        vulnerabilities, and in analyzing the effectiveness of our Service to improve the Service’s function

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">3. SHARING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>

            <p class="mb-4">We will not disclose your Personal Information except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or with your
                consent. For example, we generally do not sell, lease, or exchange your Personal Information, but if we
                ever do, we will first obtain your consent.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">This section describes to whom we disclose Personal Information, and for what purposes:</p>

            <ul>
                <li class="mb-4"><strong>Our Service Providers.</strong> We employ service providers to perform tasks on our behalf
                    and to assist us in providing the Service. For example, we use a service provider for coin generation (the Ethereum Foundation);
                    and hosting (Digital Ocean, LLC.). We take appropriate measures to help ensure that our
                    service providers provide the same level of protection for your Personal Information as we do.</li>

                <li class="mb-4"><strong>Google Analytics.</strong> We use Google Analytics, an analytics service to help us analyze
                    the traffic on the Service.  For more information on Google Analytics’ processing of Personal
                    Information, please see <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites">“How Google
                        uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps.” </a></li>

                <li class="mb-4"><strong>Advertisers.</strong> We may share certain information with advertising partners to enable
                    them to deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.  You
                    may find out more about your choices by using the Digital Advertising Alliance opt-out page located
                    at <a href="www.aboutads.info/choices.html">www.aboutads.info/choices</a> and the Network Advertising
                    Initiative opt-out page located at <a href="www.networkadvertising.org/choices.html">www.networkadvertising.org/choices</a>.</li>

                <li class="mb-4"><strong>Companies Involved in Mergers and Acquisition Transactions.</strong> If we sell or otherwise
                    transfer part or the whole of CoinPress or our assets to another organization (e.g., in the
                    course of a transaction like a merger, acquisition, bankruptcy, dissolution, or liquidation),
                    any information collected through the Service, including Personal Information, may be among the
                    items sold or transferred. </li>

                <li class="mb-4"><strong>Law Enforcement, Government Agencies, and Courts:</strong> We may disclose Personal Information
                    at the request of law enforcement or government agencies or in response to subpoenas, court orders,
                    or other legal process to establish, protect, or exercise our rights or to defend against a legal
                    claim or as otherwise required or allowed by law, or to protect the rights, property, or safety of
                    any other person. We may also disclose Personal Information to investigate or prevent a violation
                    by you of any contractual or other relationship with us or your illegal or harmful activity.  </li>
            </ul>


            <p class="text-lg mb-4">4. PERSONAL INFORMATION TRANSFERRED FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">If you are using the Service from outside the United States, please be aware that your information may be
                transferred to, stored, and processed in the United States. The data protection laws of the United States
                might not be as comprehensive as those in your country. By using the Service, you consent to your
                information being transferred to the United States for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">5. HOW WE PROTECT THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>

            <p class="mb-4">We use commercially reasonable safeguards to help keep the information collected through the Service
                secure and take reasonable steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your identity before
                granting you access to your account.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Despite these efforts to store Personal Information in a secure operating environment that is not
                available to the public, we cannot guarantee the security of Personal Information during its
                transmission or its storage on our systems. Further, while we attempt to ensure the integrity and
                security of Personal Information, we cannot guarantee that our security measures will prevent third
                parties such as so-called hackers from illegally obtaining access to Personal Information. We do not
                represent or warrant that Personal Information about you will be protected against, loss, misuse, or
                alteration by third parties. </p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">6. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY</p>

            <p class="mb-4">CoinPress does not knowingly collect or solicit any Personal Information from children. In the event that
                we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child without parental consent, we will
                promptly take steps to delete that information. </p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">7. YOUR DATA SUBJECT RIGHTS</p>

            <p class="mb-4">If you would like to access, amend, erase, export (i.e., data portability), or object to or restrict
                the processing of, your Personal Information, you may submit a request to <a href="mailto:admin@coinpress.cc">admin@coinpress.cc</a>.
                We will promptly review all such requests in accordance with applicable laws.</p>

            <p class="mb-4">Depending on where you live, you may have a right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority or
                other regulatory agency if you believe that we have violated any of the rights concerning your Personal
                Information.  We encourage you to first reach out to us at <a href="mailto:admin@coinpress.cc">admin@coinpress.cc</a>,
                so we have an opportunity to address your concerns directly before you do so.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">8. OPTING OUT OF RECEIVING E-MAIL COMMUNICATIONS</p>

            <p class="mb-4">With your permission, we may send notifications, newsletters, promotions, or other information via email
                (“<strong>Communications</strong>”). You may follow the unsubscribe instructions in any
                email you receive. Please note that certain Service-related Communications are necessary for the proper
                functioning and use of the Service and you may not have the ability to opt out of those Communications.</p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">9.  RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION</p>

            <p class="mb-4">We will retain your Personal Information for the period necessary to fulfill the purposes for which your
                Personal Information has been collected as outlined in this Privacy Policy unless a longer retention
                period is required by law.  </p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">10. OTHER WEBSITES AND SERVICES</p>

            <p class="mb-4">We are not responsible for the practices employed by any websites or services linked to or from our Service,
                including the information or content contained within them.  We encourage you to investigate and ask
                questions before disclosing your Personal Information to third parties, including social media sites
                on which you choose to share your CoinPress content.  </p>

            <p class="text-lg mb-4">11. CHANGES TO OUR PRIVACY POLICY</p>
