                directors, managers, shareholders, employees, agents, contractors, and other users of the Service
                (whether Founders or Wallet Users) (collectively the “<strong>CoinPress Indemnitees</strong>”), harmless from and against any all
                claims, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys’
                fees) resulting from or alleged to result from your use of CoinPress Technology or your violation of this Agreement.

            <p class="mb-4"><strong>11. Jurisdictional Issues</strong></p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                The Service are controlled and operated by CoinPress from its offices in the United States, and is not
                intended to subject CoinPress to the laws or jurisdiction of any state, country, or territory outside the
                United States. CoinPress does not represent or warrant that the Service, the CoinPress Technology, or any
                aspect thereof, are appropriate or available for use in any particular jurisdiction. Those who choose to
                access the Service do so on their own initiative and at their own risk, and are responsible for complying
                with local laws.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4"><strong>12. Choice of Law</strong></p>
            <p class="mb-4">
                This Agreement and the rights of the parties hereunder will be governed by and construed in accordance with
                the laws of the state of Illinois, exclusive of conflict or choice of law rules. Notwithstanding the provision
                in the preceding paragraph with respect to applicable substantive law, any arbitration conducted pursuant
                to the terms of this Agreement will be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (9 U.S.C., Secs. 1-16).
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4"><strong>13. Agreement to Arbitrate</strong></p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                All disputes arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement (including formation, performance, breach,
                enforceability, and validity of this Agreement) or our operation of the Service shall be resolved by final
                and binding arbitration to be held in the English language in Chicago, Illinois pursuant to the Commercial
                Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.  The arbitrator, and not any federal, state, or
                local court or agency, shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute relating to the interpretation,
                applicability, enforceability, or formation of this Agreement, including any claim that all or any part,
                of this Agreement is void or voidable.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and
                not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather
                than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                Without prejudice to the agreement to resolve disputes in binding arbitration set forth in the previous
                paragraph, either party to this Agreement may obtain preliminary injunctive relief in a court of competent
                jurisdiction, for the purpose of enforcing any of the terms of this Agreement pending a final determination
                in arbitration or permanent relief for the purpose of enforcing arbitral awards.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4"><strong>14. Changes to Terms</strong></p>

            <p class="mb-4">
                We may revise and update this Agreement from time to time, and will post the updated Agreement to the Service.
                UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED IN THE AMENDED VERSION OF THIS AGREEMENT, ANY CHANGES TO THIS AGREEMENT WILL APPLY
                IMMEDIATELY UPON POSTING.  Although we are not obligated to provide you with notice of any changes, any
                changes to this Agreement will not apply retroactively to events that occurred prior to such changes. Your
                continued use of the Service will constitute your agreement to any new provisions within the revised Agreement.
            </p>

            <p class="mb-4"><strong>15. Miscellaneous Terms</strong></p>

            <p class="pl-8 mb-4">
                (a) <strong>Complete Agreement.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and
                CoinPress relating to your use of, and access to, the Service and CoinPress Technology and supersedes any
                prior or contemporaneous agreements or representations.  This Agreement may not be amended except as set
                forth in Section 16 of this Agreement.  For avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding this Section, this Agreement
                does not modify, revise, or amend the terms of any other agreements you may have with CoinPress.
            </p>

            <p class="pl-8 mb-4">
                (b) <strong>Construction.</strong> If any portion of this Agreement is ruled invalid or otherwise unenforceable,
                it shall be deemed amended in order to achieve as closely as possible the same effect as originally drafted.
                Any invalid or unenforceable portion should be construed as narrowly as possible in order to give effect to
                as much of this Agreement as possible.
            </p>

            <p class="pl-8 mb-4">
                (c) <strong>Other Interpretative Provisions.</strong> Descriptive headings contained in this Agreement are
                for convenience only and shall not control or affect the meaning or construction of any of this Agreement.
                The words “this Agreement,” “herein,” “hereby,” “hereunder,” “hereof,” and words of similar import refer to
                this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular Section, subsection, or subdivision unless expressly so
                limited. The words “this Section,” “this subsection,” and words of similar import refer only to the Section,
                or subsection hereof in which such words occur. The words “either,” “or,” “neither,” “nor,” and “any” are
                not exclusive. The word “including” (in its various forms) means including without limitation.
            </p>

            <p class="pl-8 mb-4">
                (d) <strong>No Waivers.</strong> Our failure to enforce or exercise any provision of this Agreement or
                related right will not constitute a waiver of that right or provision.
            </p>

            <p class="pl-8 mb-4">
                (e) <strong>No Assignments and Transfers.</strong> No rights or obligations under this Agreement may be
                assigned or transferred by you, either voluntarily or by operation of law, without our express written
                consent and in our sole discretion.
            </p>

            <p class="pl-8 mb-4">
                (f) <strong>Language of this Agreement.</strong> Although this Agreement may be translated into other
                languages, the English language version of this Agreement shall control in any dispute between the parties.
            </p>

            <p class="pl-8 mb-4">
                (g) <strong>Third Party Beneficiaries.</strong> Except for Section 6, which is for the benefit of Founders,
                nothing in this Agreement will confer upon any person, other than the Parties, any rights, remedies,
                obligations, or liabilities whatsoever.
            </p>

            <p class="pl-8 mb-4">
                (h) <strong>Relationship of the Parties.</strong> Nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed
                as creating any agency, partnership, franchise, business opportunity, joint venture or other form of
                joint enterprise, employment or fiduciary relationship between the Parties, and neither Party shall
                have authority to contract for or bind the other Party in any manner whatsoever. No relationship of
                exclusivity shall be construed from this Agreement.
            </p>

            <p class="pl-8 mb-4">
                (i) <strong>Notices.</strong> You can provide any notices to us under this Agreement by e-mail or mail
                using the contact information provided in Section 18.  Unless you tell us otherwise, or the law requires
                otherwise, you agree to receive all communications from us by e-mail or through posting notices to your
                account in the Service. You are responsible for providing CoinPress with up-to-date contact information,
